# XmenCharacters
A Swift application that shares Xmen character information and uses the UIKit framework.


It's a small application I created to reinforce what I learned during my Swift and UIKit learning process. Recently, when the new trilogy of the Avengers came out, I had the idea of making such an app while watching the series from the beginning. I shared what kind of methods I applied in the files with the comment lines.

If I need to mention briefly under the headings:
[UITableView]
>[UITableViewDelegate]
>> numberOfRowsInSection
>[UITableViewDataSource]
>> cellForRowAt
>>> didSelectRowAt

Extra [UIViewController] for segue.

[UITableViewCell]
> defaultContentConfiguration
> contentConfiguration

Navigation Controller
